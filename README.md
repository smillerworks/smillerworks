Hello! I'm Sarah Miller, and this is my portfolio GitHub account. My portfolio represents my four years at Kennesaw State University as a Computer Game Design and Development major as well as both a Computer Science and Software Engineering minor. I know C# and Unity pretty well, and have experience in a few other languages like C++, Python, and Javascript/HTML.
If you're interested in my work, contact me at <b>smillerworks@protonmail.com<b>. I'd love to work for/with you!
